# Artificial-Intelligence
The capacity to acquire, comprehend, and use knowledge and abilities to address issues or accomplish objectives is referred to as intelligence. The goal of artificial intelligence (AI), a subfield of computer science, is to build robots that are capable of reasoning, learning, perception, and decision-makingâ€”tasks that typically require human intelligence.

AI can be viewed from two main perspectives: 
Acting and thinking humanly, and acting and thinking rationally. Acting and thinking humanly refers to the goal of creating machines that can mimic human behavior and intelligence. Acting and thinking rationally, on the other hand, refers to the goal of creating machines that can reason logically and make optimal decisions based on available information.

# History of AI
## Year 1955: An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial intelligence program"Which was named as "Logic Theorist". This program had proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.
## Year 1956: The word "Artificial Intelligence" first adopted by American Computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. For the first time, AI coined as an academic field.

The history of AI dates back to the 1950s, with the development of the first AI program, called the Logic Theorist, by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. Since then, AI has evolved significantly, with many breakthroughs in fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and machine learning.

The foundations of AI are based on various fields such as philosophy, economics, psychology, sociology, and linguistics. These fields provide insights into human intelligence, behavior, and language, which are essential for creating intelligent machines. Neuroscience, mathematics, computer science, and control theory are also critical to AI, as they provide the technical foundation for creating intelligent systems.

AI has many applications across various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and education. For example, AI can be used to develop intelligent assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, to help users perform tasks more efficiently. In healthcare, AI can be used to develop diagnostic tools and personalized treatment plans for patients. In finance, AI can be used to detect fraud and predict stock prices. In transportation, AI can be used to develop self-driving cars and optimize traffic flow.

Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, and its applications are only limited by our imagination and creativity.
